# Introduction to Machine Learning – Course Projects  

This repository contains machine learning projects completed with my colleague [Michał Iwicki](https://github.com/Michal-Iwicki) as part of our university course, **Introduction to Machine Learning**. We tackle common problems used to learn machine learning. 

### Projects  

1. **Android Malware Detection** – We analyzed telemetry data to classify Android malware. Dataset: [Android Malware Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/subhajournal/android-malware-detection?select=Android_Malware.csv).  

2. **Clustering Forum Posts** – We applied clustering techniques to group posts from various online forums. While NLP played a role, the project primarily focused on clustering methods.
